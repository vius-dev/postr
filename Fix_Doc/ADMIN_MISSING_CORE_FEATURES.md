Based on my analysis of the admin panel, here's what's missing for a Twitter-like admin system:

Missing Core Features:
1. Trending & Discovery Management
No ability to manage trending topics/hashtags
No trending posts curation
No "What's Happening" section control
No ability to manually promote/demote trending items
2. Content Moderation Tools
❌ No bulk actions (mass delete, mass suspend)
❌ No content filtering/search by keywords, hashtags, or media type
❌ No automated rule enforcement (e.g., auto-flag spam patterns)
❌ No content appeal system for users
❌ No ability to hide/show content without deletion
❌ No sensitive media labeling
3. User Management Gaps
❌ No verification badge management (blue check, etc.)
❌ No IP/device tracking for ban evasion
❌ No user notes/internal admin comments
❌ No account age restrictions
❌ No email/phone verification status
❌ No rate limiting controls per user
4. Reporting System Enhancements
❌ No report priority/severity levels
❌ No assignment of reports to specific admins
❌ No report history/audit trail
❌ No bulk report handling
❌ No automated report categorization
❌ No reporter credibility scoring
5. Analytics Gaps
❌ No engagement metrics (likes, retweets, replies over time)
❌ No user growth charts/graphs
❌ No content performance metrics
❌ No geographic distribution
❌ No peak usage times
❌ No retention/churn rates
❌ No revenue/monetization tracking
6. Safety & Compliance
❌ No DMCA/copyright claim handling
❌ No legal hold/data preservation
❌ No GDPR/data export requests
❌ No age-gating for sensitive content
❌ No automated toxicity detection
❌ No appeals queue
7. Communication Tools
❌ No direct messaging to users (warnings, notices)
❌ No announcement/broadcast system
❌ No email notification management
❌ No template messages for common actions
8. Advanced Features
❌ No A/B testing controls
❌ No feature flag management
❌ No API rate limit monitoring
❌ No bot detection/management
❌ No advertiser/promoted content management
❌ No spaces/audio room moderation
9. Audit & Logging
❌ No admin action logs (who did what, when)
❌ No change history for user accounts
❌ No export functionality for reports/data
❌ No compliance reporting
10. UI/UX Issues
❌ No pagination for large datasets
❌ No advanced filtering/sorting
❌ No dashboard with quick actions
❌ No real-time updates/notifications
❌ No dark mode
❌ No keyboard shortcuts
What we Currently Have:
✅ Basic user management (toggles for active, limited, shadow banned, suspended, muted)
✅ User search
✅ Basic analytics (counts)
✅ Report viewing and dismissal
✅ Post/comment deletion
✅ User detail view

Priority recommendations: Start with bulk actions, better analytics with charts, audit logging, and automated content moderation rules to make this admin panel production-ready.
